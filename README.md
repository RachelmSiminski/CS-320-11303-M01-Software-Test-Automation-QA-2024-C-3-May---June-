<h3>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</h3>
<p>This best way to ensure code is secure and functional is to approach the entire lifecycle with security and testing in mind. One helpful development method is "test driven development", which is where you create tests based on the requirements then implement only enough code to pass the tests. This method ensures that you are only using as much code as necessary, helping to prevent excess and redundant code. Another way is to ensure you are following secure coding guidelines, like implementing secure coding techniques.</p>
<h3>How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?</h3>
<p>I interpreted the user's needs by first making sure I fully understood the requirements. Each requirement included more than one request, so I broke each requirement down and ensured that I address each part of each requirement.</p>
<h3>How do I approach designing software?</h3>
<p>My approach to designing software is to try to follow everyting I have learned in my classes so far. I make sure I fully understand what is expected from me, then I come up with the design for the project and try to outline what I need in the code. From here I start implementing, and I make sure to test as I go, which helps reduce the number of issues I run into later. Once the code is "complete" I start conducting system tests and contuing tweaking until I'm happy.</p>
